How It Works

Users type a message into the chat input field and send it.
The message is forwarded to the AI API, which processes the input and returns a response that is displayed in the chat interface.
The chatbot connects to an AI model through the OpenRouter API. User messages are transmitted to the API endpoint, processed by the model, and the generated response is returned and displayed within the chat interface.
